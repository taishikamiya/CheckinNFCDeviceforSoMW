# What's this device
This device is a terminal device to read membership card of the service.  
The device includes 'Adafruit PN532 RFID/NFC Breakout and Shield' and a microcontroller 'MKR1000'.

# How it works
I provide a Arduino sketch and a Processing sketch. Thus you need to install Arduino IDE and Processing beforehand.
#### Arduino
Firstly, you'll need to upload the sketch into MKR1000. Connect MKR1000 microcontroller and open 'SoMW_Checkin.ino' with Arduino IDE, then press upload button.  
#### Processing
After that, open 'RFID_Action_for_Keynote.pde' on the Processing and run it.

I tested it by Arduino IDE 1.6.9 and Processing 3.3.5.

# How to use
Run the processing sketch, you can check-in and check-out using the membership card, you can use the RFID card of 'Adafruit PN532 RFID/NFC Breakout and Shield'. Â 
This source code is just detecting 'check-in' and 'check-out' using a RFID card. As a example, this program has a function sending 'space key' to feed slides on Keynote App on Mac. Of course you can play any games by space key using RFID card.
